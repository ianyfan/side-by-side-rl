Advantage actor-critic (<abbr>A2C</abbr>)
<p>
  Advantage actor-critic was introduced in
  <cite>
    <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.01783">Asynchronous Methods for Deep Reinforcement Learning</a>
  </cite>
  by Mnih et al. in 2016 as the asynchronous advantage actor-critic algorithm <abbr>A3C</abbr> but is generally implemented without asynchronicity without loss of performance (<a href="//openai.com/blog/baselines-acktr-a2c/">source</a>).
  <br>
  It is an on-policy policy gradient algorithm where the objective is the advantage function.
