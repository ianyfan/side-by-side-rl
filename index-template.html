      <h1>Side-by-side RL</h1>
      <p>
        To improve at reinforcement learning, people are often told that one good way is to find a research paper, read it, and then implement the algorithm described in it.
        This would be relatively straightforward if papers clearly outlined their training procedure (which they sometimes don't) and all of their implementation details (which they often don't).
        <a href="//amid.fish/reproducing-deep-rl">Unfortunately, it isn't.</a>
        Consequently, implementations are riddled with little tricks that are not related to the algorithm, just to get it to work.
        Trying to refer back to it, especially after some time, results in confusion about how the algorithm relates to the code, even with <a href="//spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/">help</a>.

        This website is an attempt to aid with the last problem by laying out various popular RL algorithms, transcribed exactly from their papers, side-by-side and line-by-line with their exact implementation in code.
        Each algorithm corresponds to a code file in the <a href="//github.com/ianyfan/side-by-side-rl">source repository on GitHub</a> that can be used to explore any non-algorithm-related details and to test it.
      </p>

        However, these implementations are the minimum possible to work in basic environments and should only be used as reference.
        They are not <a href="//docs.ray.io/en/latest/rllib/">performant</a> or <a href="//stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/">stable</a> and <a href="//docs.cleanrl.dev/">most implementation details</a> are not considered.
